There are a couple ways I can find the user’s needs. There are some questions I have. I want to know how I would go about interpreting how to find out the needs of each different user and incorporate their needs into their program. How can “user stories” help us?  Each different user that will be able to access different programs will be conducted in have their profile customized to fit their needs. I have determined the best way to customize each different profile is being able to get to know each specific user. 
Since the users can customize their profiles, it will make it easier for each different user to customize their own special profile and needs.  I think it is important that after the user creates a profile, they can take a small personality quiz to customize their profile. The user can apply their basic knowledge of the website to select their preferences on their profile so the software will be able to suggest trips, transportation, and activities for each user’s trip. After gathering the user’s specifications and information our system will be able to customize the website and profile. 
 One part of this process is creating user stories based off the product backlog. By having a backlog, we can keep the customized needs and wants of each user that uses the website. The user stories will provide each team member with a list of required and completable assignments to perform and complete a specific function within the program or system.
How do can I approach developing programs? What agile processes would I like to show and incorporate in my software when developing the website. I hope to incorporate specific items in my software, so I can customize the proper customization filters into the software website. I would like to be able to use a test code, so I am able to test the website before it is presented to the stakeholders. I treat this as one big user story. 
I will also be able to break down the different steps of the program development into several different categories. Some of the categories include individual sprints, constantly testing code. As the software is in the development stages I will be able to work out the bugs and kinks in the software so myself and the design and development team can improve the software for the finished product. 
Since we are only able to go forward and not backwards in the future, I would like to be in the process of developing a project just for myself so I am able to test and figure out improvements I would be able to make and incorporate into my software that I would be creating in the future. As we know there will remain a SCRUM team consisting of different roles (product owner, scrum master, developer, and tester), completing all associated tasks for each team member. Every member of the SCRUM team will be vital to improving software, brainstorming, and creating new software for each different project. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? While working as a team it is a good idea to get together with the team you will be working with to discuss the plans and design for every project. If a person would like to be a good team member, they will be able to get their own work done as well as helping their teammates out on the project if they require help. Being in a team, however, does not necessarily mean that one person should do all the work, this means that if you are able to do your work while still being able to help your teammates your team will be able to complete the project successfully. Being a good team member is a very good trait that companies and teams look for. If you can work as a team and succeed as a team. One quality that some team members lack is being able to accept constructive criticism.
